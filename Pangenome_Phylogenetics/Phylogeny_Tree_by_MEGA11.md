## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of molecular biology
- Computer with internet connection
- Sequence data of your organism

## Installation
1. **MEGA11 Software**
   - Download from [MEGA official website](https://www.megasoftware.net/)
   - Follow installation instructions for your operating system

2. **Barrnap**
   - Required for 16S RNA sequence generation
   - Installation instructions vary by operating system

## Workflow

1. **Sequence Generation** → 2. **BLAST Analysis** → 3. **Sequence Alignment** → 4. **Tree Construction** → 5. **Tree Visualization**

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Generate 16S RNA Sequence
- Use Barrnap to generate the 16S RNA sequence from your genomes
- Verify sequence quality and length

### 2. BLAST Analysis
1. Visit [NCBI BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)
2. Select 'Blastn' for nucleotide sequence analysis
3. Input your sequence and run the analysis
4. Download results:
   - Select aligned sequences
   - Save in .txt format
   - Download CSV file for record-keeping

### 3. Sequence Preparation
Create a text file with sequences in the following format:
```
>Organism_Name_Location_Year
ACTGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG
```

### 4. MEGA11 Analysis
1. Launch MEGA11
2. Create new alignment:
   - Click `Align` → `Build New Alignment`
   - Select DNA sequence type
   - Import sequences (`Ctrl+D`)
3. Perform alignment:
   - Use MUSCLE algorithm
   - Select UPGMA for rooted tree construction
   - Save in MEGA format

### 5. Tree Construction
1. In MEGA11:
   - Select `Phylogeny`
   - Choose desired tree type
   - Adjust parameters as needed
   - Set p-value if required

### 6. Tree Visualization
1. Visit [iTOL](https://itol.embl.de/)
2. Upload your tree file
3. Edit visualization settings
4. Export in desired format

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure sequences are in correct FASTA format
- Verify sequence alignments before tree construction
- Check for gaps and misalignments in sequences

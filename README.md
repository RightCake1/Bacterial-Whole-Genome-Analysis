# Bioinformatics Characterization Guide
## ðŸ§¬ Introduction
Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide to bacterial genome characterization! This repository aims to bridge the gap between novice bioinformaticians and the complex world of biological data analysis. As someone who started from scratch in this field, I've designed this guide to be as accessible and comprehensive as possible.
## ðŸ“š About This Repository
This is a living document that grows with my journey in bioinformatics. You'll find detailed workflows, step-by-step instructions, and practical tips for various bioinformatics analyses. The guide focuses on bacterial genome characterization, covering essential tools and techniques used in modern genomic research.
## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Find
The repository contains detailed documentation for:
- Genome assembly and quality assessment
- Gene prediction and annotation
- Comparative genomics workflows
- Popular bioinformatics tools and their applications
All procedures are documented with clear instructions and explanations of the underlying concepts.
## ðŸ”„ Continuous Updates
